# AI Digital Payment Failure Predictor

This repository contains a clean, scalable project scaffold for building an end-to-end
system to generate synthetic payment data, train models, provide an API for predictions,
and expose a Streamlit frontend.

Project layout:

- data/ (raw and synthetic)
- notebooks/ (data exploration and EDA)
- src/ (data generation, features, models, prediction logic)
- app/ (Streamlit frontend)
- tests/ (unit tests)
- docs/ (architecture and design notes)

Quick start:
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Populate `data/raw` or run synthetic generation (not implemented yet)
4. Run notebooks for EDA and development

Notes:
- This scaffold intentionally contains only placeholders; no training or dataset code is included.
